\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Recognizing handwritten text means transforming a graphical representation of text into its symbolic representation.
Handwritten recognition is used in a wide variety of applications.
This paper describes and empirically evaluates a handwritten text recognition system based on Hidden Markov Models.
The results show that Hidden Markov Models can successfully be used for handwritten recognition.

\input{introduction}

%Write about other papers and how they have solved the problem.

%Describe our limited version of the problem.
%Describe the two problems, one is recognizing characters and the other is to recognize words.
%1. Images have strokes of width 1.
%2. Assume characters segment in word.

\section{Method}\label{sec:method}

This section describes the handwritten text recognition system. It starts by giving a top level overview of the system and then it describes the details such as the HMM implementation, feature extraction and the datasets used for training. 

%2. General overview of our implementation.   Kjell

\section{Result}\label{sec:result}

In this section we present the results from evaluating the system described in Section~\ref{sec:method}.  
We discuss the results in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}. 
Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:future_work} we present some future changes to the system that we believe will improve the results.

%1. (Started Kjell) Test of different initialization methods and number of training examples for word recognition 
%1. (Started Kjell) Test different feature extraction parameters
%1. Maybe result from character test using different initialization algos.
%2. Basic results from testing the implementation
%3. Better to do in appendix? Depending on how much other results we have, discuss experience of playing around with the gui.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}
%1. Discuss the results.
%2. Discuss importance of amount of training data and the effects on performance.
%3. Discuss possibility of training words with data from character classification
%4. Discuss how our approach might work for word recognition
