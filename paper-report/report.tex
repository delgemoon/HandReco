\title{Summary of Modeling Customer Relationships as Markov Chains}

\section{Introduction}
The lifetime value (LTV) of a customer is the net present value of the cash flows attributed to the relationship with a customer.
Phillip E. Pfeifer and Robert L. Carraway \cite{customer} explain how the LTV concept can be used together with Markov Chain Models (MCM) to make managerial decisions on an individual customer basis. %explains or explain?
The advantages MCM has over traditional methods include its flexibility and that it is a probabilistic model.
A probabilistic model explicitly accounts for the uncertainty surrounding customer relationships.
It also allows the use of the language of probability and expected value when reasoning about a firm's future relationship with an individual customer.

In marketing, the Recency Frequency Monetary (RFM) framework is commonly used and it fits nicely with MCM.
Recency describes how long ago the customer purchased something.
Frequency describes how many times the customer has bought something from the firm.
Monetary value describes the average value of the customer purchases.
These concepts are used to define the states in the MCM.

The MCM consists of the following vectors and matrices: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The one-step transition matrix \textbf{P} defines the state transition probabilities.
\item The reward vector \textbf{R} describes the reward received in each state. The reward can also be negative which means that the company spends more on the customer than the customer gives.
\item The value vector \textbf{V} describes the expected present value of a customer in a specific sate. If the value is negative then that customer is effectively a loss for the company.
\end{enumerate}

Equation \ref{eq1} shows how the value vector \textbf{V} is defined in terms of the transition matrix \textbf{P} and reward vector \textbf{R} with a finite time horizon T.
The discount factor $d$ sets how much future rewards are discounted when calculating the present value.
\begin{equation}\label{eq1}
\textbf{V}^T = \sum_{t=0}^T  [(1 + d)^{-1} \textbf{P}]^t \cdot \textbf{R}
\end{equation}

When considering an infinite time horizon, the equation changes to Equation \ref{eq2}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq2}
\textbf{V} \equiv \lim_{T \rightarrow \infty} \textbf{V}^T = \{\textbf{I} - (1 + d)^{-1} \cdot \textbf{P} \}^{-1} \cdot \textbf{R}
\end{equation}


Therefore, given the economic and probabilistic assumptions of the model, the firm can evaluate the expected present values by calculating $\textbf{V}$. For example, if the last value in the vector $\textbf{V}$ is negative, it tells that the firm can do relatively better when curtailing its relationships with this customer earlier.

According to the observation above, one can modify the Markov decision model model easily. Possible ways to do that are to use less states or to set the $\textbf{p}_t$ values with corresponding negative values $\textbf{v}_t$ in $\textbf{V}$ to zeros and the corresponding elements $\textbf{r}_t$ in $\textbf{R}$ to zeros as well.%$\textbf{v}_t$ one value but equal to zeros?

Furthermore, whenever purchase probabilities, remarketing expenditures and net contributions depending on recency are considered in the model, MCM can be adjusted to it by expanding the state space and breaking out the original recency 1 state into several new states. The states are  corresponding to the listed affecting factors which depend on customer recency at the time of purchase. 

The MCM can not only be used for customer migration situations, but also for customer retention situations. For customer retention, the firm could start with a fairly simple model by assigning MCM to have three states:  \textit{Prospect}, \textit{Customer} and \textit{Former Customer}. 

The last case discussed in the paper illustrates how to apply MCM to a situation where the firm believes that purchase probabilities, net contribution, and remarketing expenditures all depend on the recency, frequency and monetary value of past purchases. The MCM uses states defined by $\textbf{(r, f, m)}$ where the elements are integers with some upper bounds. Particularly, monetary value categories are paid much attention and single last purchase amount is chosen instead of a moving average to avoid its non-Markovian nature.




\section{Discussion}

%Write a report on the article. The report must summarize the material (in no more than 2 pages), and then also include your own judgement and ideas. What are the authors main points? Do you agree?

The authors' main purpose with the paper is to show that MCMs can be used to model many different customer relationship scenarios. It is done by some examples of scenarios that can be modeled with MCM. They also show with examples how the models can be used to change a company's relationship policy. They argue that MCMs can be useful due to it's flexibility. This is illustrated by the examples. For example MCMs can be used to model customer retention and customer migration scenarios. One advantage of using MCM for customer relationship problems seems to be that the MCM naturally account for the stochasticity in customer relationships. %What is stochasticity and why does the model naturally account for it?

The authors do not write anything about the validity of the assumptions underlying the models. For example, they assume that ending a relationship with a customer is to prefer, if the expected value of the customer's future purchases will be less than the cost of the relationship. This and other assumptions made in the models may be oversimplification in some cases. For example if the customer relationship is about sending out commercial, the relatives of the customer might see the commercial, so even if the targeted customer will not purchase anything the relationship might create new customers. However, the purpose of the paper is not to present a very accurate model or to discuss all problems that the models can have but to show some use cases for MCMs.
